**Project Title: Midas - Where Community Meets Campaigns**

## Overview

The Midas project aims to address the challenges faced by Web3 administrators in managing communities and executing successful marketing campaigns. It provides a comprehensive solution for community building, innovative marketing, score-based rewards, and streamlined workflow, making it easier to manage web3 communities and campaigns.

## Problem Solving

**Community Building:**
Midas allows users to easily create and manage exclusive, token-gated communities, fostering engagement and loyalty. Granting exclusive access to community members based on the tokens they hold encourages active participation.

**Innovative Marketing:**
The platform enables high-impact gleam campaigns, supercharging brand growth and user interaction. Users can launch campaigns with innovative and impactful features.

**Score-Based Rewards:**
Midas offers a unique approach to rewards by distributing digital assets through Red Envelopes. Users with higher campaign scores receive earlier access, enhancing engagement and fairness.

**Streamlined Workflow:**
Midas serves as an all-in-one solution for simplified and efficient management of web3 communities and campaigns. It combines various features into one platform, making administration more accessible and efficient.

## Challenges Faced

**Push Protocol Integration:**
One of the major challenges during development was integrating the Push Protocol into the platform. The staging environment presented issues with real-time communication and updates. To overcome this, the team worked closely with the Push Protocol provider's support team, identified limitations in the staging environment, and adjusted the integration strategy for seamless real-time engagement features.

**Pivoting for Market Fit:**
Initially focused on Red Envelopes in the De-Fi market, the team faced stiff competition. To find the right product-market fit, they pivoted towards an all-in-one solution for web3 community and campaign management. This strategic shift allowed Midas to address a more significant market gap and create a compelling, differentiated product.
